What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- You create the file structure required for git to track commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The working directory contains the versions of the files belonging to the commit that was last checked out. It can also include additional files, not 
(yet) tracked by git. Files can be modified in the working directory. A snapshot of a file can be added to the staging area, which means that snapshot will be included in the next commit. A file can have three states: modified, staged or commited.

ISSUE
- I can't get sublime to open the right .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG, why? -> blijkbaar moet een wijziging van de core.editor altijd via git config --replace-all gebeuren, anders pakt ie niet...

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- By adding only the files that belong to a logical change to the staging area and leave others that may have been touched for other reasons in the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- When you want to implement (experimental) changes without polluting the main branch. Branches allow you to implement multiple versions of a project that later can, but don't have to be, merged. (Note that the term version is actually not entirely correct when refering to branches).
- Branches are a good way to compartimentalize your work. Your master branch is the production quality branch. Whenever you start to work on a specific feature you can create a new branch and create working on that branch until all work is completed. In the mean time you can switch to the master branch should you need to fix a bug before you'll introduce the new feature. It's good practice to create a branch for every separate piece of work, just to be able to context-switch quickly.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- They look like a tree
