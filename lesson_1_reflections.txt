- Using a file compare tool makes it more efficient to isolate differences and identify potential bugs.
- Version Control allows you to trace back all the changes over time. By comparing version, it becomes easier to identify the change that introduced a bug.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- git log lists all commits in reverse chronological order, with a short description of the change
- git diff compares two commit id's and shows the insertions and deletions
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- VC allows you to go back to any commited version of your code. If you introduce a bug, you can always go back.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- Version controling my first Udacity Android project!! Woo-hoo!
